NOTE - The samples for this chapter have been superceded by those from the 2nd edition. Python 2.7 is no longer used, and there are changes to the Azure Storage SDK. Please check the 2nd edition versions at https://github.com/fouldsy/azure-mol-samples-2nd-ed/tree/master/04


These samples expect you to run Python 2.7 with the Azure Python SDK for Python. Hopefully the SDK becomes more stable with Python 3.x.

When working in the Azure Cloud Shell, run the following commands to install the appropriate packages required by these samples:

```
pip2 install --user azurerm azure-cosmosdb-table
```

To then run each sample in the Azure Cloud Shell, make sure you use the Python 2.7 binary. As an example:

```
python2.7 storage_table_demo.py
```
